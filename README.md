Functional Programming Workshop

## Introduction
This workshop is to educate the team about functional programming, this isn't about FP vs OO, it's also not just about using functions instead of classes. Functional programming is a collection of principles based on mathematics that promise less bugs, enhanced readability, increased maintainability and much more.

We are going to be taking a look at these principles and seeing how we can fit it into our everyday. We'll be going back to basics so please try and approach this workshop as a total newbie, so temporarily forget everything you know about JS. If you don't initially understand, your instinct might be to reject, but be patient, learning FP is a gradual process.

## Benefits
* Code that reads like English significantly reduces cognitive load
* Leads to more efficient problem solving in terms of quality and speed
* Reduced surface area for bugs to dwell
* Using components to only focus on rendering and handling side-effects provides a clear seperation of concerns
* Better adoption of TDD and improved testing experience
* Easier to find and remove duplicate code (much easier to look for words than syntax)

## Goals
* Discover a middle ground between how we do things and FP
* Raise awareness of the importance of pure functions, immutabability etc...
* Get used to using functions as data
* Spark an interest

## Main Goal
* Encourage the team to start using function composition
