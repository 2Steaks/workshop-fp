Functional Programming Workshop

## Introduction
This workshop is to educate the team about functional programming in practise, this isn't about FP vs OOP, it's also not just about using functions instead of classes. Functional programming is a collection of principles based on mathematics that promises confidence, less bugs, easing cognitive load and much more.
We are going to be taking a look at these principles and seeing how we can fit it into our everyday.
We'll be going back to basics so please try and approach this workshop as a total newbie, so temporarily forget everything you know about JS.
If you don't initially understand, your instinct might be to reject, but be patient, learning FP is a gradual process.
There are different ways of writing FP, you could use a lib like Lodash/FP or Ramda OR you could go all in with Monoids, Functors, Monads and Tasks etc.

## Goals
* Discover a middle ground between how we do things and FP
* Raise awareness of the importance of pure functions, immutabability etc...
* Shift in thinking to result in improved readability
* Get used to using functions as data
* Spark an interest

## Main Goal
* Encourage the team to use function composition

## Benefits
* Code that reads like English significantly reduces cognitive load
* Leads to more efficient problem solving in terms of quality and speed
* Reduced surface area for bugs to dwell, by moving all business logic to pure function modules
* Using components to only focus on rendering and handling side-effects provides a clear seperation of concerns
* Better adoption of TDD and improved testing experience
* Easier to find and remove duplicate code (much easier to look for words than syntax)

## What to Bring
* Install Runjs with ramda - https://runjs.dev/
* Keep ramda docs open - https://ramdajs.com/
* Bring functions that are inflexible or hard to read
