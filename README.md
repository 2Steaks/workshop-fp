Functional Programming Workshop

## Introduction
This workshop is to educate the team about functional programming in practise, this isn't about FP vs OOP, it's also not just about using functions instead of classes. Functional programming is a collection of principles based on mathematics (no math involved) that promises confidence, less bugs, easing cognitive load and much more.
We are going to be taking a look at these principles and seeing how we can fit it into our everyday.
We'll be going back to basics so please try and approach this workshop as a total newbie, so temporarily forget everything you know about JS.
If you don't initially understand your instinct might be to reject, but be patient, learning FP is a very gradual process.
There are different ways of writing FP, you could use a lib like Lodash/FP or Ramda or you could go all in with Monoids, Functors, Monads etc.

## Goals
* Discover a middle ground between how we do things and FP
* Raise awareness of the importance of pure functions, immutabability etc...
* Shift in thinking to result in improved readability,  FP reads like 1+1 (when you're used to it)
* Get used to using functions as data
* Spark an interest

## Main Goals
* Encourage the team to learn function composition
